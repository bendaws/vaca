# hund - a man's best friend
Hund is a small interpreted language made simply to improve how current small languages work. It is a pretty simple remix of Lua 5.4. It changes some syntax rules, so most Lua and Python developers can transition over easily.

The name comes from Norwegian, it is the word for dog. It is named that because I like dogs.

Hund is in a very early development stage, so you should stay clear of it for now.
